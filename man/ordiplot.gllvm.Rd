\description{
Plots latent variables and their corresponding coefficients (biplot).
}
\details{
Function constructs a scatter plot of two latent variables, i.e. an ordination plot. 
Latent variables are re-rotated to their principal direction using singular value decomposition,
so that the first plotted latent variable does not have to be the first latent variable in the model.
If only one latent variable is in the fitted model, latent variables are plotted against their corresponding row indices.
The latent variables are labeled using the row index of the response matrix y.

Coefficients related to latent variables are plotted in the same figure with the latent
variables if \code{biplot = TRUE}. They are labeled using the column names of y. The number
of latent variable coefficients to be plotted can be controlled by ind.spp. An argument alpha
is used to control the relative scaling of the latent variables and their coefficients.
If \code{alpha = 0.5}, the latent variables and their coefficients are on the same scale.
For details for constructing a biplot, see Gabriel (1971).

For a quadratic response model, species optima are plotted. Any species scores that are outside the range 
of the predicted site scores are not directly plotted, but their main direction is indicated with arrows instead.
This ensures that the plot remains on a reasonable scale.

Effects of environmental variables in constrained ordination are indicated with arrows.
If any of the arrows exceeds the range of the plot, arrows are scaled to 80% of the plot range,
but so that the relative contribution of predictors is maintained.
If standard errors are available in the provided model, the slopes of environmental variables
for which the 95% confidence intervals do not include zero are shown as red, while others 
are slightly less intensely coloured.

For constrained ordination, a conditional plot includes both fixed- and random-effects to 
optimally represent species co-occurrence patterns, corresponding to "conditional" site scores in \code{\link{getLV.gllvm}}.
Marginal corresponds to an ordination plot that excludes residual patterns (i.e. excluding the random-effect),
so that it is only available with num.lv.c>0 or num.RR>0. A conditional plot requires num.lv.c>0. 
The "residual" type corresponds to an ordination diagram of only residual patterns. 
See \link{getLV.gllvm} for details.
